# Chainlit Message Representations and A2A Protocol Integration

## Project Description

**Research and Development of Chainlit Message Representations and A2A Protocol Integration**

This project aims to:

1. **Study Chainlit's native message representations**: Research and develop implementations of Chainlit's built-in message representation classes that feature distinctly different UI rendering styles for displaying messages from external LLM APIs, including their practical coding methods.

2. **Explore custom message representation implementation**: Investigate and develop the feasibility of implementing custom message representations and their UI presentations using the same architecture, functions, and interfaces as the native message representations.

3. **Design A2A protocol response structure**: Research and develop the optimal structure for A2A protocol's JSON-RPC 2.0 responses to fully leverage the benefits of both native and custom message representations.

4. **Develop integrated testing methodology**: Research and develop methods for testing the complete integration of message representations (native and custom) with A2A protocol responses as a unified system.
